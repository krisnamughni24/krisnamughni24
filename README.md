Hi there! I'm Krisna Mughni, dedicated and motivated Back End Engineer with a passion for developing innovative and efficient solutions to complex problems. My technical skills and experience in coding and data management have allowed me to contribute to several successful projects. Additionally, I am also interested in the intersection of technology and creativity and have a keen interest in audio/music production, Game Dev, 3D modeling, and the use of DL/AI in these areas. I am always open to new opportunities and would welcome the chance to connect with like-minded professionals in my network. Let's connect!
